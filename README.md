# About the Project <a name="1"/>
Implementation of the effects of Crepuscolar Rays based on the technique developed by Kenny Mitchell. <br/> <br/>
This project features four scenes to represent the volumetric light scattering technique in different scenarios.
It is also provided animations of the elements in the scene to demonstrate the efficiency of this technique.<br/> <br/>
This project is based on the two following papers wich descride the technique applied:
- [GPU Gems 3](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems3/part-ii-light-and-shadows/chapter-13-volumetric-light-scattering-post-process)
- [Lighr Scattering with OpenGL](https://fabiensanglard.net/lightScattering/)
## Built With <a name="2"/>
- [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/): It's a Javascript 3D Library
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/): It's a module bundler, its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser

# Usage <a name="3"/>
## Installation <a name="4"/>
